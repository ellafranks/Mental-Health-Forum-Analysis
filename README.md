In our current climate, online solutions to those seeking advice are not good enough.
 
The SuicideWatch Reddit forum has over 190k members with only 10 human moderators that monitor and remove abusive posts. This is tedious and timely. 

Exposure of comments are based on the ‘score’ and the time in which they are posted. Exposure is not related to the content of the post. For sensitive online communities, it is vital that we are able to filter and detect any comments that may impose harm.  

If one is able to identify important features in high and low scoring comments in mental health threads, this could help improve the handling and moderation of suicidal intentions on social media platforms.
